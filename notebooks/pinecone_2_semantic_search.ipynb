However, he said, electric vehicle adoption is taking place more slowly than the company expected, in part because of higher costs.Ford's traditional business operations, known as Ford Blue, earned $2.31 billion during the quarter, while it's Ford Pro commercial business earned $2.39 billion. Its \"Model e\" electric vehicle unit lost $1.08 billion from April through June.The company said it now expects to lose $4.5 billion on the EV business this year, widening losses from roughly $3 billion a year earlier.Here's how Ford did during the second quarter, compared with what Wall Street expected based on average estimates compiled by Refinitiv:Adjusted earnings per share: 72 cents vs. 55 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $42.43 billion vs. $40.38 billion expectedThe automaker reported net income of $1.92 billion, or 47 cents per share, substantially up from a year earlier when it earned $667 million, or 16 cents per share.Ford said its adjusted earnings before interest and tax, or adjusted EBIT, jumped to $3.79 billion, up from $3.72 billion a year ago.
